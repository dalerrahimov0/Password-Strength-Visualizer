Password Strength Visualizer

A lightweight, clientâ€‘side web app that evaluates password strength in real time and explains why a password is weak or strong. It estimates entropy, shows a colorâ€‘coded meter, and provides a crackâ€‘time estimate with clear, actionable tips.

ðŸ”§ Features

Realâ€‘time analysis as you type
Colorâ€‘coded strength meter (Weak / Okay / Strong / Excellent)
Entropy estimate (bits) based on character set and length
Rough offline crackâ€‘time estimate (at an assumed guesses/sec)

Heuristics for common weaknesses:

  Dictionary words & l33t variants (e.g., password, letmein, qwerty, months)
  Common keyboard sequences (e.g., qwerty, asdf, 12345)
  Repetition & sequential patterns (e.g., aaaaaa, abc123)
  Year endings and common suffixes (e.g., 2024!)

Clear tips to improve strength

100% clientâ€‘side (no passwords leave the browser)
